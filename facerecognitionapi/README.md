# Backend of the project.

**The dependencies for successfully running the server are-**
* express.js(framework for node.js)
* bodyParser.js(access the contents of request.body)
* cors.js
* knex.js(connect the database to the server)

**The database used is PostgreSQL.** We need to have PostgreSQL installed and an instance running locally at port 127.0.0.1(you can change the port in server.js)
